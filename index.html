        <h1>Welcome !</h1>

        <br><h2>About me</h2>

        <p>Hi, my name is Olivier Casalta, 36. I live in Christchurch New Zealand and love this place for its quality of life. I like playing music and doing all sort of outdoors sports like spearfishing, climbing, mountain biking, etc.</p><br>
        <p>I originaly come from Montpellier in France where I grew up and studied. I graduated with my master's degree in Mechatronics 11 years ago and went to work abroad for major construction projects as a supervisor.</p>

        <br><h2>Job Search</h2>

        <p>I am looking for a new challenge that requires technical and managerial skills for projects in Christchurch. My international experience on site allows me to respond to any kind of emergency situations and solve problems that commit responsibility, authority and skills</p><br>
        <p>Over the last years, I have mainly worked overseas as a manager for the construction and the commissioning of new power plants in Algeria, France and Estonia. Those large projects greatly expanded my technical proficiency in the electro-mechanical industry and strengthened my motivation to drive groups as well. All my solid experiences on site have consistently transformed my way of work and enhance my ability to manage teams and subcontractors.</p><br>
        <p>My last work position in an automation company, leader in the BMS for commercial projects, gave me a very good understanding of New Zealand standards in the construction industry.</p><br>
        <p>Today, I am following online courses regarding computer science from Harvard University. It is a good way to update skills and to keep training his brain during this long lockdown.</p>
        
        <br><h2>About this website</h2>

        <p>I first designed this website to achieve the cs50x week 8 problem called "Homepage". Features in html, css and javascript have been created to fulfill the requirements of this problem set. Then, I have added more elements to make this website a little bit easier to share other information, so that you can see my profile with a different view in addition to my resume. Enjoy!</p>
